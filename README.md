# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Download data examples, create database in PostgresSQL and upload the existing data into the database by creating a table "all_sessions" and inserting data into the database. Analyze risks, find dublicates and number of different parametrs to analyze the data

## Process
### 1. Download data sample
### 2. Create 'all_sessions' table in the PgAdmin4 and insert data into the existing table
### 3. Upload data and make sure the number of colums and data matches
### 4. Go through series of queries to test, clean and analyze the data

## Results
Different number of sales and products sold per territory or city

## Challenges 
Some of the queries are quite challeging and I am not sure I did it all correct

## Future Goals
Spend more time studing the quyeries and how to call the required information in PgAdmin4 to analyze the data
